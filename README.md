# Concept-Drift

Concept drift is the phenomena where the data's distribution changes through time, compelling machine learning models to adapt and adequately adress the issue.

Two main projects are presented here.
1. "Real_Datasets_Experiments" is a project containing 7 experiments done with real world datasets containing naturally or manually induced concept drift.
2. "Bayesian Networks/Constraint_Based_Project" is a project showing experiments done testing my algorithm that learns a bayesian network structure (NP-hard problem) in a smart and efficient manner.
